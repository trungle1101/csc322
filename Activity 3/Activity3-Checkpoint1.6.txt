Subdivision add more polygon into the object, more complexity for object structure. 
Smooth shading help us render smoother. We can't see distinct polygons anymore. But if structure is not small enough, we still see some egde in the transfer area

Strategy is using smooth shading and increasing the number(lever) of subdivision one by one to see some how we can observe no egde in the transfer area.
